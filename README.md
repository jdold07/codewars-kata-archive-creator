# Codewars Kata Description Markdown File Generator

## What it does...

Designed to to access Kata information from the Codewars API, from a user's completed Kata data (also from the API) and generate a detailed Kata description as a markdown file. The file is generated and saved into an organised file structure.

## Why it does it...

I'm trying to organise a mess of completed Kata files on my own system that have accumulated over the course of my time on Codewars. I generally prefer to code in my own familiar IDE setup in favour of the online editor. Over time this has amounted to an unordered mess that I always had intentions of sorting.

In another project, I am organising all my completed solutions into a Github repository in order to:

1. Organise all the mess in a consistent format
2. A way to get more practice with Git and making it part of the flow
3. Finally getting around to understand unit testing by creating tests for each completed Kata
4. And now, with this app, writing an app to automate some of the repetitive work.

### Thanks to the creators of some existing modules used in this app

Special thanks to [IonicaBizau](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/json2md) as finding his json2md app gave me the motivation to pursue creating this as an actual app.
