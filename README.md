### _For maintaining & organising your completed [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) Kata solutions_

## **What it does...**

Designed to to access Kata information and a user's completed Kata information provided through the [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com) API. Then, armed with that, produce a detailed Kata description as a markdown file and save this to disk in an organised file structure.

<br>

## **Why do it...**

I'm trying to organise an absolute mess of completed Kata files on my own system that have accumulated over the course of my time on [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com). I almost always prefer to code the solutions in my own familiar IDE setup in favour of their online editor. Over time this has amounted to an unordered mess of saved files that I always had intentions of getting sorted.

In another project, I will be organising all my completed solutions into a Github repository in order to:

1. Organise all the mess in a consistent and organised format
2. Maintain a kind-of place of reference for me (and now others) to refer to
3. Get more proficient with Git and making it part of the normal flow
4. Finally getting around to understand unit testing by creating tests for each completed Kata
5. And now, with this app, writing an app to automate some of the repetitive work.

<br>

## **The snowball effect...**

So this kind of evolved from just generating the description as a markdown file for me to more of a complete import solution.

Once I got the markdown file thing sorted, I looked at the files of completed Kata on my system and thought ... _"this is too much, I'll never sort this out"_. At the time of making this, I think I had completed around 750 Katas or thereabouts. I also knew, that a large chunk of those weren't saved at all or were sitting (unlabelled) in a sort of scratch pad single file.

So, I decided to import my solutions by grabbing them all from [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com). Unfortunately, the API doesn't provide for this. So this information needed to be scrapped from my profile page. I coded out a basic scrape, format and file write to get all my solutions in order and that was fine...

Now, determined to make testing a part of this whole beast, I decided to go ahead and scrape the tests for all the Kata I had completed as well. This took a fairly similar approach to gathering my code solutions so wasn't a big stretch.

Now all that was done as a big initial import, I needed a way to keep it up-to-date. So I re-wrote the whole thing to filter existing from new and allow for the updating of one, many or additional languages of existing Katas.

## **Where am I up to?**

So, it's functional ðŸ¥³ and I think it now does most everything I need it to do. However, there are still several tweaks I know I'd like to make. The main things I'm aware of are:

1. âœ… ~~Currently, when grabbing solutions from the profile page, it only reads the first page of the infinite scroll. I just haven't needed anything more than this, so I haven't done it. As I update it frequently, I don't need solutions beyond the first page, as the list is sorted most recent to oldest. For a bulk import, this would not be sufficient, and you would want to be able to collect all solutions.~~ ðŸ¥³ This has now been added! Including a config option flag to get all or only the first page.
2. While looping what needs updating, it currently calls to make the root kata folder and the markdown description for each completed language of a given Kata. I want to modify this to remove these unnecessary calls.
3. Finish commenting all the code to it's explicit as to what everything is doing (preferably before I have to work it out again ðŸ˜«)
4. Create all the types properly to eliminate the tons of any's that I'm currently using ðŸ˜œ
5. Documentation for the app in regards to installation, configuration and running the app
6. Currently the app uses a session ID to access the user profile and tests for Kata the user has completed. This is a bit of pain, as it requires grabbing that from Dev Tools and updating the config regularly. I'd like to find a better solution to handling authentication.
7. I'm sure there are other things, but the escape me right now

But, for the time being, it works! So I'll see where it goes from here.

## **Thanks to the creators & maintainers of the dependency modules I use to make this app work!**

An extra shout-out to [IonicaBizau](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/json2md). Although he/she/they would't know it, finding this module gave me the motivation to pursue actually creating an app from this idea of mine.
